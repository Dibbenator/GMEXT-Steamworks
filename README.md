# GMEXT-Steamworks
Repository for GameMaker's Steamworks Extension

This repository was created with the intent of presenting users with the lastest version available of the extension (even previous to marketplace updates) and also provide a way for the community to contribute with bug fixes and feature implementation.

This extension will work on Windows, macOS and Linux.

VISUAL STUDIO SOURCE: `source/Steamworks_vs/`

XCODE SOURCE: `source/Steamworks_xcode/`

After compilation the exported dll/dylib/so file is automatically copied into the extension folder inside the included GameMaker project folder.

## Requirements

In order to compile for Windows/macOS/Linux you are required to [download the Steam SDK v1.55](https://partner.steamgames.com/dashboard) and place it inside `source/steamworks_sdk/`
